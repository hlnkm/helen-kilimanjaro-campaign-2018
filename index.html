      		  <p>Hello friends, family, and internet!</p>
      		  <p> 
      		  	 My name is Helen Kim and I'm going to climb Mt. Kilimanjaro's Northern Circuit - <b>the longest route</b> up the mountain - to raise awareness and funding for Parkinson's research.
      		  </p>
      		  
      		  <p>
      		  	My funding goal is $19,341 - $1 for each foot of elevation gain. All of your contributions will go directly to funding cutting edge research supported by the Michael J. Fox Foundation (MJFF) for Parkinson's Research. 
      		  </p>

          	<b>MOTIVATION.</b> In 2007 my father was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease. He fought a brave and courageous fight until he passed away in 2015. Although the years following his diagnosis were at times very trying and sad for all of us, we are happy knowing he was able to meet his 3 beautiful granddaughters  who loved him very much. For those of you who knew Michael Kim, you know that he lived to dance, cook, smile, and laugh. He was a truly loving, kind and compassionate man. His love and courage in life is what has inspired me to climb Mt. Kilimanjaro as a member of Team Fox to raise money to benefit the MJFF research efforts for a cure. 
          </p>
          <p>
          	<b>TRAINING.</b> Since January of 2018, I've been preparing for the climb. Along with long and consistent hours training at the gym, I have been learning about the terrain and preparing gear and materials for the trip to Tanzania. For those of you who know me, I am neither athletic or much of a camper.  My idea of "roughing it" is a four star hotel, so you know this cause is very personal and important to me! 
          </p>
          <p><b>CLIMB.</b> I will be taking the Northern Circuit Route up Mt. Kilimanjaro. It is not only the longest, but the most beautiful with some of the highest success rates (I don't plan on failure!). My trek will take place between July 25, 2018 to August 1, 2018.</p>

          <p>Please join me on my journey as I will be broadcasting my progress through a GPS tracker which you can follow along at <a href="http://track.helenkim.net/" target="_blank">track.helenkim.net</a>.</p>

          <p> Five million people worldwide are living with Parkinson's disease - a chronic, degenerative neurological disorder.  In the United States, 60,000 new cases will be diagnosed this year alone.</p>

          <p><b>There is no known cure for Parkinson's disease.</b></p>

          <p>But through your support of Team Fox, you can help change this. Team Fox is the grassroots community fundraising program at The Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research (MJFF). MJFF accelerates high-impact science through smart risk taking and problem solving with a commitment to urgency and efficiency.
          </p>

          <p>I'm one of thousands of people around the globe who are turning their passions into Team Fox fundraisers to help them speed a cure for Parkinson's. When you contribute to my campaign, 100% of Team Fox proceeds go straight to MJFF research programs</p>
