      		  	 <span class="highlight-campaign">My name is Helen Kim</span> and I'm going to climb Mt. Kilamanjaro's Northern Circuit - <b>the longest route</b> up the mountain - to <span class="highlight-campaign">raise awareness and funding for Parkinson's research</span>.

          	<b>MOTIVATION.</b> In 200X <span class="highlight-journey">my father (late, 2015) was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease</span>. The years following were trying times for me and family, but we are happy knowing he was able to meet his 3 beautiful grandchildren who loved him very much. For those of you who knew Michael Kim, <span class="highlight-journey">you know that he lived to dance, cook, smile, laugh</span>, and bring joy to those around him. While my father is no longer with us, there's still much to be researched to find treatments and cures for the terrible thing that is Parkinson's. 
          </p>
          <p>
          	<b>TRAINING.</b> Since January of 2018, <span class="highlight-journey">I've been preparing for the climb</span>. Along with long and consistent hours training at the gym, I have been learning about the terrain and preparing gear and materials for the trip to Tanzania. 
          </p>
          <p><b>CLIMB.</b> I will be taking the Northern Circuit Route up Mt. Kilamanjaro. It is not only <span class="highlight-journey">the longest, but the most beautiful with some of the highest success rates</span> (I don't plan on failure!). My trek will take place between July 25, 2018 to August 1, 2018.</p>

          <p>I will be broadcasting my progress through a GPS tracker which you can follow along here.</p>

          <p> Five million people worldwide are living with Parkinson's disease - a chronic, degenerative neurological disorder. <span class="highlight-foundation">Parkinson's really sucks</span> - it's hard to diagnose and basically <span class="highlight-foundation">affects your ability to produce dopamines</span> - yeah, you know those chemicals in your brain that signal motivation and motor control - and in the United States, 60,000 new cases will be diagnosed this year alone. </p>

          <p><b>There is no known cure for Parkinson's disease.</b></p>

          <p>But through your support of Team Fox, <span class="highlight-foundation">you can help change this</span>. Team Fox is the grassroots community fundraising program at The Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research (MJFF). (yes Marty McFly from Back to the Future has Parkinson's) <span class="highlight-foundation">MJFF accelerates high-impact science</span> through smart risk taking and problem solving with a commitment to urgency and efficiency.
          </p>

          <p>I'm one of thousands of people around the globe who are turning their passions into Team Fox fundraisers to help them speed a cure for Parkinson's. When you contribute to my campain, <span class="highlight-foundation">100% of Team Fox proceeds go straight to MJFF research programs</span></p>
